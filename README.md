# advent-of-code-2018

In the spirit of the holiday season, @topaz has made a nifty [advent calendar](https://adventofcode.com) with new coding challenges each day.  This repo contains my solutions to the problems from the advent of code calendar.

I'm using this opportunity to learn some new programming languages and brush up on skills from languages I already know.  If anyone happens to stumble across this repo, feel free to take a look / provide feedback via PR :).

## Usage

The challenges are listed as &lt;daynumber&gt;&lt;first/second&gt;.  Within each challenge directory, you'll find a solution listed by language.
